/// data structures --- as well as other general data structures this type
/// depends on --- take a minimalistic view of LLFSM semantics. The idea here
/// is to establish a semantics within the meta model which all schedulers
/// share. Any additional data that is required for custom semantics of a
/// particular scheduler is enabled through the use of `Attribute`s and
/// `AttributeGroup`s which provide a type agnostic interface for specifying
/// such data.
///

/// structures for specific concrete implementations --- `SwiftMachines.Machine`
/// for swiftfsm machines for example.
